<h2>Check Trial Monitor</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An ISA monitoring plan consists of the specifying a minimum number of patients and follow-up (FU) time
You must specify the minimum and the final analysis FU time.  This is done by specifying the
elements vMinQtyPats and  vMinFUTime  with at least 2 elements.   The first elements define when to
start monitoring based on a number of patients enrolled with additional FU and the last elements in the vectors
define when to do the final analysis .  For example, if an ISA will enroll up to 200 patients and  we define the elements in the following way
vMinQtyPats &lt;- c( 30, 200 )
vMinFUTime  &lt;- c( 3,  3)
would start monitoring patients 3 months after the 30th patient enrolled and the final analysis (FA) would be done 3 months after the 200th (last patient) enrolled
</p>
<p>To increase flexibility there are two options for adding additional IAs.  Which option is used is based on dQtyMonthsBtwIA ==0  or &gt; 0
Option 1:  the vMinQtyPats and vMinFUTime are of equal length with length &gt; 2 then the trial would consist of length( vMinQtyPats )-1 IAs and 1 FA
Example:    dQtyMonthsBtwIA  &lt;-  0
vMinQtyPats     &lt;- c( 30, 90, 150, 200 )
vMinFUTime      &lt;- c( 3,  3,  0,    3)
Would perform  IA 1 at 3 months after the 30th patient enrolled, IA 2 at 3 months after the 90th patient enrolled, IA 3 when the 150th patient enrolled,
(not since the 3rd element of vMinFUTime = 0 IA 3 is performed when the 150th patient is enrolled) and the FA is performed 3 months after the 200th patient
NOTE: With dQtyMonthsBtwIA &gt; 0 and length( vMinQtyPats ) &gt; 2 &ndash;&gt; ERROR and stops running
</p>
<p>Option 2: You MUST have the lengths of vMinQtyPats and vMinFUTime equal to 2.
Example:    dQtyMonthsBtwIA &lt;-  2
vMinQtyPats     &lt;- c( 30, 200 )
vMinFUTime      &lt;- c( 3,   3)
This option will run the first IA 3 months after the 30th patient.  After that, the ISA is monitored every 2 months (vQtyMonthsBtwIA[1])
and the FA is 3 months after the 200th patient
</p>
<p>Return: list( vRunISAAnalysis, vPreviousIATime )
vRunISAAnalysis = 1 if the ISA needs to have the IA run and 0 otherwise
vPreviousIATime &gt; 0 for the option when vQtyMonthsBtw[1] &gt; 0 so we can track when the IA is done and know when the next one is to be done.
</p>
<p>In both cases, vIsFinalISAAnalysis = TRUE if dCurrentTime &gt;= time of the FA as defined above; otherwise it is set to FALSE
</p>
<p>If vISAStatus != 1 then for the corresponding ISA elements in the return list this function returns
vRunISAAnalysis = 0, vPreviousIATime = vPreviousIATime , vIsFinalISAAnalysis = FALSE, vCase = corresponding case )
</p>
