<h2>MakeTrialDecision</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function determines the status of a trial (all ISAs) based on the input. Each ISA
can be in one of eight states. The following list provides the details of the returned vISAStatus and what
they mean.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Status 0</dt><dd><p>The ISA is not open, the virtual trial is at a point prior to the ISA opening.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Status 1</dt><dd><p>The ISA is open for enrollment.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Status 2</dt><dd><p>The ISA has met the maximum enrollment.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Status 3</dt><dd><p>The ISA was closed with a Go BEFORE Final Analysis (FA).  This can be a Final status for an ISA because it was closed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Status 4</dt><dd><p>The ISA was closed with a No Go BEFORE FA.  This can be a Final status for an ISA because it was closed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Status 5</dt><dd><p>The ISA was closed with a Go at FA.  This can be a Final status for an ISA because it was closed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Status 6</dt><dd><p>The ISA was closed with a No Go at FA.  This can be a Final status for an ISA because it was closed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Status 7</dt><dd><p>The ISA was closed with a Pause at FA.  This can be a Final status for an ISA because it was closed.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The Status options of 3 or 4 indicate the ISA was closed early, before the FA, either for a Go or a No Go.  The options 5-7
all were closed at the FA.
