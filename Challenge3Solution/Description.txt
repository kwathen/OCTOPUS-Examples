Requirements:
    OCTOPUS - Most recent version - https://kwathen.github.io/OCTOPUS/
    If you are on a Grid the OCTOPUS package could be installed in a subdirectory, such as RLibrary if needed and then just reference the
    correct package.  The same approach could be taken if you are not running on a grid.

    Example:
    Install Using Remotes Package
    remotes::install_github( "kwathen/OCTOPUS")

    Reference
    library( "OCTOPUS", lib.loc = "RLibrary" )




Description
The goal of this project is to create a single ISA platform and compare 2 design options.   The first design option will have 1 interim analysis and the second will have 2.  

The patient data should be simulated from a normal distribution and do t-test to compare treatments.   Then use known cutoff values obtained for something like EAST in your decision making.
