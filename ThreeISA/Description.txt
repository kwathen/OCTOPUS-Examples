Description
This example template project is intended to give the user a starting point.
Start by reading the BuildMe.R or BuildMeRunMultiCore.R files.
This example has 3 ISAs.   For each ISA, the first interim analysis is done when half the patients have 6 months of FU, then montly thereafter.  The control arm utilizes a Beta( 10, 40 ) prior.   ISAs 2 and 3 have fewer patients on control.  This can be found in the TrialDesign.R file.   

In addition, for ISAs 2 and 3 the ISA start time (when the trial enters the platform) is a random unifor between the time provided and 3 months, eg ISA2 starts some time betwen months 6 and 9 and ISA 2 starts some time between months 12 and 15.  The ramp up in recruitment rate is slower for this example.  Both of the changes can be found in the SimulationDesign.R file

The trial design object is created using the function in TrialDesign.R
The simulation design is created by the function in the SimualtionDesign.R
