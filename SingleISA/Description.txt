Requirements:
    OCTOPUS - Most recent version - https://kwathen.github.io/OCTOPUS/
    If you are on a Grid the OCTOPUS package could be installed in a subdirectory, such as RLibrary if needed and then just reference the
    correct package.  The same approach could be taken if you are not running on a grid.

    Example:
    Install Using Remotes Package
    remotes::install_github( "kwathen/OCTOPUS")

    Reference
    library( "OCTOPUS", lib.loc = "RLibrary" )




Description
This example template project is intended to give the user a starting point.
Start by reading the BuildMe.R file.
The trial design object is created using the function in TrialDesign.R
The simulation design is created by the function in the SimualtionDesign.R

In this example the platform trial will consist of a single Intervention Specific Appendix (ISA) which had control and experimental. 
A new patient simulation is added called "Binary" and the function SimPatientOutcomes.Binary.R is where the patient data is simulated.
A new analysis is added called BetaBinomial that uses a Beta Prior on Binary Data (conjugate model for ease) and the analysis function can be found in RunAnalysis.BetaBinomial.R
